---

This repository is the home of Kavier, the first scientific instrument for 
predicting performance, sustainability, and efficiency of LLM ecosystems under 
inference, through discrete-event, cache-aware simulation.

Kavier helps operators, researchers, and engineers predict:
* **Performance** — pre-fill & decode latencies, throughput, GPU utilization  
* **Sustainability** — energy, Wh/Mtoken/s, carbon emissions (kgCO2/Mtoken/s)  
* **Financial efficiency** — €/Mtoken/s given GPU-hour prices
